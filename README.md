# Jul-Aug
Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a collection of industry-relevant personal  projects completed during July and August. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply  DA &amp; ML to solve real-world business problems using tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, and Advanced Excel.


ðŸ“Œ Car Price Prediction Bot ðŸš—

ðŸ“„ Project Summary:
This machine learning project predicts the resale price of used cars by analyzing structured features like brand, model year, mileage, and fuel type. The model uses Linear Regression combined with a sklearn pipeline and OneHotEncoder for categorical handling. The data underwent rigorous cleaning and feature engineering for improved accuracy.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

1. Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

2. Linear Regression, OneHotEncoding

3. Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering

4. Pipeline, Model Tuning with RÂ² Optimization

ðŸ“ˆ Features & Highlights:

1. Cleaned dataset: removed non-numeric and missing values (year, kms_driven, fuel type, etc.)

2. Built model pipeline with 1000 iteration random state tuning

3. Final model ready for prediction using real-time input

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metric:
RÂ² Score optimized across multiple train-test splits for stability.

ðŸ’» Laptop Price Prediction Bot

ðŸ“„ Project Summary:
An advanced ML solution to predict laptop prices based on technical specifications like CPU, GPU, RAM, screen resolution, and memory type. The project explores and compares multiple algorithms (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, Random Forest, etc.) and uses log-transformed price, PPI, and custom memory parsing for improved regression results.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:

1. Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

2. scikit-learn, XGBoost, Multiple Regression Models

3. Feature Engineering (PPI, Touchscreen, OS, GPU brand)

4. OneHotEncoder, Pipeline, MAE & RÂ² Evaluation

ðŸ“Š Features & Highlights:

1. Custom parsing logic for CPU, GPU, Memory (HDD/SSD separation)

2. Model comparison across 7+ algorithms

3. Created a scalable pipeline for future deployment

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics:

1. RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

2. Heatmap & correlation analysis for feature impact
